# 🏥 Eli Lilly Clinical Trials Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides an **end-to-end analysis** of **Eli Lilly's clinical trials**, covering **data cleaning (Python), analysis, and visualization (Tableau)**. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about clinical trial trends, intervention types, trial durations, and global distribution.

---
## 🛠 Project Workflow
### **1. Data Cleaning (Python)**
✔ Removed duplicates and cleaned text fields for consistency.  
✔ Extracted **Country** and **State** information from messy location data.  
✔ Fixed country name inconsistencies (e.g., **Taiwan, Türkiye, Czechia**).  
✔ Saved a cleaned dataset for further analysis and visualization.

### **2. Data Visualization (Tableau)**
✔ **Dashboard Features:**
- 📍 **Clinical Trial Distribution by Country**
- ⏳ **Average Trial Duration Across Phases**
- 💊 **Breakdown of Intervention Types**
- 📈 **Growth Trends in Drug vs. Non-Drug Trials**
- 🎯 **Top Research Focus Areas** (e.g., Oncology, Metabolic Disorders)
